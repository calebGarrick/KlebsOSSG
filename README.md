A repository to track my progress working on my open smart glasses

## Progress Notes

### 5/12/23

I just received my tinyPico, I will begin by just getting used to the development environment of coding off of it.

Bashed my head into a wall flashing the micropython, I just didn't read how to put it in boot mode like a buffoon. Now following the [micropython tutorial](https://youtu.be/5W3WvXAmDJc?list=PL6F17pWypPy_KSmpnR5CV8x78QhAiKBIl), installing dependencies and all that bs.

Starting to get the hang of the Pin interface, back in the swing of writing python. Going to invest in the capture card so I can tinker with display code before I get the actual display.

My plan for the weekend is to figure out bluetooth and loading pdfs and breaking them up if they are too large. Not sure if it's worth, buy I may upgrade to the [pro or feather s3](https://esp32s3.com/) for the extra memory.
